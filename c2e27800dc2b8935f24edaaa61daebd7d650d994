      "message": "the OpenApiService change from Response to InputStream is not exactly nice, as it ignores the implementation reality -- where we are writing things out.\n\nso perhaps this needs a better look underneath to see what is it exactly that we are doing, because we should really prefer a MessageBodyWriters, which is consistent what we have in RESTCONF (JaxRsFormattableBodyWriter).\n\nthat way we can then ride the same infra restconf-server will will have to support FormattableBody -- and plugin whatever we end up having here.",
