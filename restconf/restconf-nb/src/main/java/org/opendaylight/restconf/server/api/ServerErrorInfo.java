// FIXME: String here is legacy coming from RestconfError. This really should be a FormattableBody or similar, i.e.
//        structured content which itself is formattable -- unlike FormattableBody, though, it needs to be defined as
//        being formatted to a output. This format should include writing.
// FIXME: given that the normalized-node-based FormattableBody lives in server.spi, this should probably be an interface
//        implemented in at server.spi level.
