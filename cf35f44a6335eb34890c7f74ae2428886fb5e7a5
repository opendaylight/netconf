      "message": "Our current logic not allow us to change POSTs in the way it will work. Currently if example body contains many element: containers/lists/leafs and other - restconf throws error because we can\u0027t POST multiple elements (see JsonNormalizedNodeBodyReader#propagateExceptionsAs). Idea of this patch was to alter examples for requests and POST just empty JSONs and XMLs with just name of the element (see task description). It also complicated and main issues was that we can have only one POST per Path and other one - mandatory fields - they also cause problems. Here I did request bodies for JSONs but it is far from perfect. Not talking about XML.\n\nI\u0027m not sure we should continue with that way of solving POST problems because in the end if we solve all issues and create request body with data like it should be - it will look like PUT request that already working.",
