      "message": "There are two more futures chained after this. What if `sourceResolverFuture` is already completed and cannot be canceled?\n\nAnd even if cancellation is attempted during `onRemoteSessionDown`. It may be possible that the task is completed before it\u0027s canceled and then `handleSalInitializationSuccess` is processed when `connected \u003d true`:\n- `onRemoteSessionDown`\n  - Schema processing complete\n  - Cancel future (cannot be canceled)\n- `onRemoteSessionUp` (wins over `handleSalInitializationSuccess`)\n- `handleSalInitializationSuccess`\n  - salFacade.onDeviceConnected\n  \nI think this is very unlikely to happen in practice but this looks like a feasible path at least in theory.",
