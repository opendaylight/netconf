/**
 * A {@link Sender} bound directly to the underlying transport channel. This is how event streams are delivered over
 * HTTP/1: there is no provision for executing other requests while the event stream is active.
 *
 * <p>
 * While it might be possible to service requests after the stream has ended (on our side), implementing that would be
 * quite complicated, as we essentially would have to shutdown channel reads while we are sending the stream -- except
 * we cannot do that, because TLS underlay needs bidirectional communication for rekeying. Hence we would have to buffer
 * all requests until the stream finishes -- i.e. exerting no backpressure on the client and accumulating state, which
 * is a recipe for a DoS.
 *
 * <p>
 * Hence what this does is drop any request we receive and terminate the connection when the stream ends. That way we
 * are fully compliant with the HTTP specification.
