    //        - RpcReply can only be sent on a ServerSession
    //        - NotificationMessage can only be sent on a ServerSession which has seen a subscription request
    //
    //        There are further state management issues: without interleave capability the client gives up the right
    //        to execute most operations.
    //
    //        At the end of the day, this method should be exposed from AbstractNetconfSession only, with perhaps a
    //        different signature.

    //          - is it <close-session>, https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6241#section-7.8, available to client?
    //        - state transitions:
    //          - what happens sendMessage()'s still in the output TCP buffer?
    //          - what happens to those that are on the wire?
    //        - synchronicity: is this a non-blocking operation?
    //        - if it is blocking: what is its non-blocking equivalent?
