      "message": "Every 500 - failed modify subscription. Will be resolved with fix for datastore write.\nFilteringSubscriptionTest.filterNotificationNotReceivedTest - notification is not excluded - filtering is required.\nFilteringSubscriptionTest.filterNotificationPartialTest - also has typo. Addressed here: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/c/netconf/+/116524\nFew tests through out FilteringSubscriptionTest had issue that were hiding behind 500 error. Event time format of notifications and expected values were different when compared which caused assertion failures. Addressed here: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/c/netconf/+/116523\nFilteringSubscriptionTest.filterReferenceTest - 400 because filter was not found by reference. Interesting part is that it should fail before that when trying to write filter into datastore. However this does not happens. After some checks \nand debugging I came up with this patch that resolves issue when trying to populate filters in internal collection: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/c/netconf/+/116525.\nWith this and all changes above I actually got filter by reference in test and it was looking ok.",
