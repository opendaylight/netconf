      "message": "ResponseOutput#start creates ResponseBodyoutputStream which is implementation of javaâ€™s OutpustStream. Its implementation of #write uses HTTPServerSession #sendResponseStart and #sendResponsePart methods. This would require implementing these methods in HTTPServerSession  and chnages in its ServerRequestExecutor (mainly #format). I expect that HTTPServerSession#sendResponseStart and HTTPServerSession#sendResponsePart are going to use ResponseWriter\u0027 similar named methods to implement this.",
