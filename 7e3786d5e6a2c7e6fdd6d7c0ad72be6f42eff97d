This does not look to conform any RFC I know.\n\nInstead of adding new functionality I would prefer to fix existing one according to RFCs. For example: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8040#section-9.\n\nIn addition, this patch contains a lot of formatting and general coding mistakes.\n\nI would suggest to stop working on this patch/task and abandon it.",

AFAIK this functionality is currently not available. \n\nCan you please point us to the coding mistake that you have mentioned? We would like to get this functionality merged as we have tested the feature with many routers also. We can discuss further in TSC or kernel meetings also.",
