This does not look to conform any RFC I know.\n\nInstead of adding new functionality I would prefer to fix existing one according to RFCs. For example: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8040#section-9.\n\nIn addition, this patch contains a lot of formatting and general coding mistakes.\n\nI would suggest to stop working on this patch/task and abandon it.",
