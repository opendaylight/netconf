      "message": "It isn\u0027t an advertised service in the original version.  However, there may be a use case for it in the future, so  I decided to advertise it here.  In all reality, it would be an external application that would probably pull this in (like DLUX or something).  I can take it out if you would rather that, but since we already define the service I figure we might as well expose it for proper consumption.  Open to thoughts.",
