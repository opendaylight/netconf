      "message": "Like first thought would be add it into Subscription but it is wrong IMO. IIRC from our refinement session there was mentioned that checking session is not a good choice because sessions comes and goes - it make more sense to remember user that created subscription and allow him to do whatever he needs with subscription no matter what session he is on. However this is whole different topic so lets leave it for now.\nSession is only used in checks for DeleteRPC, ModifyRPC and notification streaming.\nSince by current logic we restrict access by session we still need that map. So I can think of moving it but this doesn\u0027t bring anything new - it will be same map in different place - also not.\nAlso from refinement session I recall some plans about task in our backlog that has to do with binding WebHostResource to session - may if that is done then we can just remove this map entirely and check session in different way.",

In summary storing session in Subscription not good practice but will do if we want to stick to only allowing RPCs and streaming on one and only session.\nAlternative leave this map for now and consider switching to check by user. Storing user inside Subscription already looks better but that will require some refactoring to implement.",
