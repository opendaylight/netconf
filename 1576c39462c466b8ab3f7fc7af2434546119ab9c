      "message": "This will work if subscribed to DOMNotifications. I commented it out for now because of possibility of subscription to data tree change which will lead to cast type exception. This means I can\u0027t depend on formatter inside subscribers and have to create separate one for state notifications. Currently there are two ways to do it - \n1)reuse one we already have(and it works) - inside restconf.mdsal.spi.NotificationSource or \n2)create one(but it will be copy/paste on 99%).\nFirst approach has one issue with circular dependency meaning those should be moved to restconf-server-spi.",
