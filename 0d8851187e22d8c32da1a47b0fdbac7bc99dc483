      "message": "I dont think we want to move the payload generation into the actual test run, as its going to influence the results. I cant find the input format file anywhere, but we might be able to keep the static part of the file as just two strings in memory and generate only the parametric part of the payload.\n\nIt might also be worthwhile to change the edit-content file format somewhat, as I dont think all of the different parametric parameters are even needed.",

      "message": "This fix will not make any influence on the test result. We discussed and test it with Martin Balaz on high load test. And he had already used patched test tool in his performance tests. It  reduce memory usage from 6gb to 400mb.\nDifference in test result is less than 1%. And creation of Object take 0.0252-0.1155 us of time. \nSo may I leave this changes? \n\nAlso I think Illia has a task (as far as I heard) to change something of input parameters.",
