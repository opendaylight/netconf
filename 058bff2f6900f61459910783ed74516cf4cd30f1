IllegalArgument, IllegalState\nwhich may hide original issue and lead to follow-up issue which will be more confusing.",

      "message": "Actually I think it already does - NetconfDocumentedException. However referencing NetconfDocumentedException here doesn\u0027t seem clean as it would tie restconf to a specific broker implementation. I think the underlying problem is that netconf throws unchecked exceptions from write/merge but the transaction interface doesn\u0027t not specify/document that random  runtime exceptions can be thrown. I think netconf violates the API contract in this regard - either it should delay write operation exceptions until submit or we add a specific RuntimeException and declare/document it to be thrown from write/merge/delete.",
