Similar tests are existing in transport packages, mocks used there, implementation used here. No reason to up server/client to validate the functionality of `ServerTransportInitializer` (dedicated UT is expected for this artifact)\n\nSuggested removing `{Abstract,Tcp,Ssh}NetconfServerTest` tests as duplicates (extra)",
