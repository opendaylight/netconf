So it would make more sense to add jitter to the first `backoffMillis` like other cases where `attempts !\u003d 0`.\n\nOne thing that would be helpful is clarification of `min-backoff-millis` \u0026 `max-backoff-millis` in that the values are the minimum (initial) \u0026 maximum timeout before jitter is added.",
