      "message": "I had to save ensureParentsByMerge as a private method for places where we use put transactions after we checked the parents e.g. https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/c/netconf/+/112445/23/plugins/restconf-mdsal-spi/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/restconf/mdsal/spi/data/MdsalRestconfTransaction.java#121 and https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/c/netconf/+/112445/23/plugins/restconf-mdsal-spi/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/restconf/mdsal/spi/data/MdsalRestconfTransaction.java#74\n\nIf we replace ensureParentsByMerge with merge, it will be expensive and wrong to MERGE data before PUT the same data.\n\nAlso, I have got rid of Emptysubtree logic from MdsalRestconfTransaction bc it uses RestconfTransaction#merge and ensureParentsByMerge, which is useless due to the repetition of the same action(writing parents). \n\nAs you can see here https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/c/netconf/+/112445/23/plugins/restconf-mdsal-spi/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/restconf/mdsal/spi/data/MdsalRestconfTransaction.java#146 ensureParentsByMerge no more uses RestconfTransaction#merge and writes data by DOMDataTreeReadWriteTransaction#merge",
