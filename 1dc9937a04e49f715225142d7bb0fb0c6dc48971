      "message": "This would be best way if we can add it alongside handler for streams in RestconfTransportChannelListener#onTransportChannelEstablished. Then we can also pass custom EventStreamService that also can get session from RestconfTransportChannelListener. After that adding logic for subscriptions and everything should work.\nSadly there is one issue here - having two SSE handlers intercepting GET requests with text/event-stream headers will lead to race condition (if we take ServerSseHandler the way it is written now as example). May be it is something that will be fixed in NETCONF-1419 I\u0027m not sure.",
