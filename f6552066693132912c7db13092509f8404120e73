Imagine user which installs non-cluster feature, then reconsiders, kills ODL, adds the cluster feature to featuresBoot and runs \"karaf clean\". As the file exists, it will be used as is, which means wrong file content is applied and user is left wondering what went wrong.\n\nI highly recommend to use different file name, so that user can keep customized file content for both features.",
